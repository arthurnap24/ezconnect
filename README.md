EZ-Connect: Forget the ports, focus on programming.

* Is a networking library that gives port management to the API.

* Just need to create a EZConnection object, load functions to it,
  and have persistent connection with other programs running on a
  network.
  
* There is no server/client relationship between programs anymore.
  Just a web of peers that calls each others functions (of course
  with the control of the programmer).
